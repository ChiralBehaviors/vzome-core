vzome-core
==========

vZome is a desktop application for editing virtual Zome models, or similar geometry.  This project contains the core behaviors of vZome, without any of the user interface.  The API includes a mechanism to load a document created in the desktop application, and introspect or export the resulting model.  The API should be considered provisional at this point.
